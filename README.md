Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks 2

This is my attempt to recreate my first game with all the knowledge I have gained in the past years.

The original game was created then I had just learned C++ but had yet to master the language. A lot of mistakes was made.

This is also my attempt at creating something with SMFL. 

Dependencies:
 * SFML 2.1
 * PhysFS
 * libjson-c

I shall now guarentie that it is bug for bug compatible with Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks 1

I attempt to keep the game part so small that it can be replaced at a later time.
